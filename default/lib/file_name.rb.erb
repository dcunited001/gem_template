  # Welcome to your new gem!
  # This file is the entry point for your gem. Logic can go in this file, though most gems are big enough to warrant splitting
  # functionality out into multiple files namespaced under a module named the same as a gem.
  # Create those files as lib/<%= file_name %>/foo as <%= klass %>::Foo remembering to require each file at the top of this file,
  # unless you want your users to manually require a specific file (for example opt-in feature in a distinct file)
